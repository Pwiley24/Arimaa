do the same setup for all other pieces, but with corresponding ranks and rabbits "moveBack" = false

Public class elephant {
	rank = 1
	moveBack = true
	player1 = true
	elephantImage = file of no background elephant on computer
	x = 0
	y = 0
	
	
	
}

public elephant(int newx, int newy, boolean player){
	x = newx
	y = newy
	player1 = player
}

//getters and setters for x and y and player1

public paintMethod(Graphics g){
	g.drawImage(elephantImage, x, y
}
